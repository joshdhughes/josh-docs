Matthew 27:3-10

## 1.1 Sobering 2 intentions BI
This is a very heavy and sobering text that invites us to consider some horrific realities, including suicide. 

My intention every time I stand before you is to handle the Scriptures faithfully, while also being mindful of the burdens some of you may carry. Our elders will be up front at the end of the gathering, and if this passage stirs up a strong emotion in you, it would be our joy to gently carry that with you in prayer and friendship. 

This text, for all its weightiness, can help us center our hope on the grace, forgiveness, and healing power of Christ. And my hope is that this sermon will be full of gospel hope, despite the serious and sobering subject matter. 

Let’s turn our hearts now to the nature of repentance, the fruit of godly sorrow over sin that turns to Christ empty-handed and receives his healing, restoring, and re-storying grace. 

**Here’s our big idea - Seeing to sin ourselves is death, but coming to the Savior in our sin is life.**

## 1.2 recap motion Judas BCBCAA

We know from the verses previous to these that Jesus has been handed over to the chief priests and the elders. He has been found guilty on the basis of false testimony, beaten, humiliated, reviled and slandered. He has been denied three times by Peter. Soon he will be delivered to Pilate and crucified. 

And all of this has been set in motion, humanly speaking, by Judas and his betrayal. 

I think it’s important to remember how closely Judas and Jesus have walked together these last three years. The whole time Jesus is doing miracles, teaching his divine doctrine, healing the suffering, and raising the dead, Judas was with him. By all appearances, he was no different than the rest of the 12. 

But there have been some clear indicators along the way that - to use the language I offered a couple of weeks ago to assess Judas - he belonged to the crew but he didn’t believe in the Christ. He had adjacency to Jesus but no allegiance to Jesus. 

- He doesn’t call Jesus Lord like the other disciples, he calls him Rabbi. 
- He steals from the money bag of funds that are given to help the poor to enrich himself. 
- And two weeks ago, we saw the pinnacle of his treachery, his handing over of Jesus to the religious leaders for a cash payment of 30 pieces of silver. 

## 1.3 v3 repentant? 87
But here in these verses, Judas does some things that might make you wonder about the finality of that assessment. 
- he changes his mind (v3 says this explicitly). 
- he attempts to returns the money in an act of restitution.
- he changes his testimony - he calls Jesus innocent.

And you might look at v3 and say, “he was repentant!” 

Was he? Certainly, he was remorseful, and yes, he sought restitution - but I want to submit to you that this is not repentance. 

WSC question 87 says

**Q87. What is repentance unto life?**
> Repentance unto life is a saving grace, by which a sinner, being truly aware of his sinfulness, understands the mercy of God in Christ, grieves for and hates his sins, and turns from them to God, fully intending and striving for a new obedience.

# 2 I. What is repentance?
## 2.1 change mind? 

So let’s punch in on this. Repentance is not merely changing your tune or even changing your mind. 

Perhpas you’ve hard that a common way of defining repentance is _a change of mind_. It’s true that “changing your mind” is the literal, etymological construction of the Greek compound word for repentance: metanoia _meta_-- “to change;” _noeo_ -- “the mind.”  

But to define repentance as merely to “change your mind” doesn’t fully capture the concept. _Noeo_ describes something more than mere cognition. Your _noeo_ encompasses your whole inner reality. 

So repentance is not less than intellectual turning, but it’s more than intellectual turning. It’s a turning that encompasses not only your cognition, but your volition and your affection. It’s a radical turning of your mind, your will, and your desire. 

So you can change your thinking and be remorseful... and not be repentant. 

## 2.2 Cor 7 self-pity
There is a NT picture that colors this in a bit: 2 Cor. 7. 
> 2 Cor. 7:8-10 As it is, I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you were grieved into repenting. For you felt a godly grief, so that you suffered no loss through us. For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death. 

Mere remorse, like Judas displays here, is worldly grief over sin. Worldly grief is me-centered. It revolves around my guilt and shame, my reaping of the consequences of my actions. One scholar defined it as:

> “It is not sorrow because of the heinousness of sin as rebellion against God, but sorrow because of the painful and unwelcome consequences of sin. Self is its central point.”

Worldly grief is the sorrow of self-pity, the sorrow of the caught, the sorrow that is principally over the wreckage sin brings for self. 

## 2.3 diambiguRAYt
Sometimes it’s difficult to distinguish the worldly sorrow of remorse from the godly sorrow that produces genuine repentance. But if you examine it closely, you’ll see it. Because it will produce a new cognition, volition, and affection. And if it doesn’t, it’s not repentance. 

I heard a story once of a married couple who came to a pastor for counseling - the husband had a seminary degree, he’d been a pastor and foreign missionary, he was an adoptive dad. But the marriage was estranged. His wife couldn’t stand him. 

So their pastor sat with them and heard their story; this man acknowledged some general things he needed to improve and ways he could be better... but then proceeded to launch into his litany of accusations and indictments of his wife. Like a prosecuting attorney, he laid out his case for why his wife was at fault. 

And it all led to his summary conclusion - “she wants to divorce me, but she does not have biblical grounds to pursue divorce.”  

So the pastor said, “Do you want your marriage to be healed?”

He replied, “I want that more than anything in this world.” 

So the pastor said, “Let me offer a suggestion of what you might say to your wife. Sit down with her and say to her, ‘You know, sweetheart, I don’t think you have grounds to divorce me, but God is opening my eyes to see what an arrogant donkey I am (he used another word, pastors can do that sometimes). 

“And I’m not seeing every bit of it, but God is starting to open my eyes; I’m just beginning to understand that it must be hell to be married to me. And if you divorce me, I wouldn’t hold it against you, but I want you to know, I am truly truly sorry for what I’ve put you through and I want to change with God’s help.” 

And do you know what the man said? “My wife has no biblical grounds to divorce me.” And sure enough they divorced and his arrogance brought unspeakable pain and devastation to his family and his church. 

# 3 Point one cont’d

## 3.1 Deal himself only recourse - suicide
Worldly sorrow is not godly sorrow. Remorse is not repentance. 

Judas’ actions appear to be aligned with repentance. But when the religious leaders refused to help him deal with the guilt and shame of his sin, he didn’t turn from his sin to God, fully intending and striving for a new obedience; he sought to see to it himself. He saw to it with it with the only recourse he had. 

But true repentance begins with godly sorrow that is God-centered, turns to God’s mercy, and then bears fruit in a transformed life. Perhaps the most vivid accounting of a Christian’s experience of this is David’s in Psalm 51. 

## 3.2 Psalm 51 sacrifice

- Verses 1-9 are an acknowledgement of sin and a heartfelt plea for forgiveness. 

      1       Have mercy on me, O God, 
      according to your steadfast love; 
                  according to your abundant mercy 
      blot out my transgressions. 
            2       Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, 
      and cleanse me from my sin! 

            3       For I know my transgressions, 
      and my sin is ever before me. 
            4       Against you, you only, have I sinned 
      and done what is evil in your sight, 
                  so that you may be justified in your words 
      and blameless in your judgment. 
            5       Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, 
      and in sin did my mother conceive me. 
            6       Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being, 
      and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart. 

            7       Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; 
      wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
            8       Let me hear joy and gladness; 
      let the bones that you have broken rejoice. 
            9       Hide your face from my sins, 
      and blot out all my iniquities. 

- Now listen to verses 10-19 and hear the plea for transformation, a renovation of the heart. It begins with David himself in 10-12:

            10       Create in me a clean heart, O God, 
      and renew a right spirit within me. 
            11       Cast me not away from your presence, 
      and take not your Holy Spirit from me. 
            12       Restore to me the joy of your salvation, 
      and uphold me with a willing spirit. 

- his plea then goes to other sinners in 13-19
            13       Then I will teach transgressors your ways, 
      and sinners will return to you. 
            14       Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, 
      O God of my salvation, 
      and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness. 
            15       O Lord, open my lips, 
      and my mouth will declare your praise. 
            16       For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; 
      you will not be pleased with a burnt offering. 
            17       The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; 
      a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. 
            18       Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; 
      build up the walls of Jerusalem; 
            19       then will you delight in right sacrifices, 
      in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; 
      then bulls will be offered on your altar. 

## 3.3 Sacrifice sign sufficient, only first part
And here the notion of sacrifice is introduced -- and this is critical. David will offer sacrifices in obedience to God. He needs - the whole community needs - to be washed clean by sacrifice. And on this side of Calvary we know that those sacrifices were a shadow and a sign pointing to the sacrifice Jesus is going to lay on the altar in a matter of hours.

And this, beloved, is the only remedy sufficient to deal with the terrible stain of sin. You cannot see to it yourself in a way that is satisfactory. And what Judas didn’t understand was that this was the very thing that Jesus was securing through Judas’ betrayal. 

Judas was aware of his sinfulness, but that’s only had the first part. The best part is what comes next - understanding the mercy of God in Christ, you grieve for and hate your sin, and you turn from them to God, fully intending and striving for a new obedience. 

# 4 II. What repentance requires

## 4.1 know and go, Peter Luke
What repentance requires is a proper understanding of who Jesus is and a willingness to go with him to restoration, healing, and life. 

What Judas needed more than anything in this moment of despair was to come to Jesus - like Peter did. When Jesus appears on the beach as Peter and the disciples are fishing in John 21, John says “it is the Lord!” 

And what does Peter do? He rips off his outer garment and throws himself into the sea to swim to Jesus. 

I want you to notice something about this. When Peter first encounters Jesus in Luke 5:8 and realizes who he is, he says to Jesus, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man”  - his initial response in seeing Jesus is to put as much distance between himself and Jesus as possible. But in John 21, Peter’s reaction is totally different. He goes desperately to Jesus. 

## 4.2 knew Jesus, know Jesus
And I think this change can be explained very simply - Peter in John 21 knew something about Jesus he didn’t know in Luke 5, namely, the character of this man. He knew Jesus is a kind and gracious savior who is more ready to receive me than I am to present myself, more ready to hear me than I am to speak, more ready to provide for me than I am ready to ask for what I need. 

Jesus is coming for you if you’re in him. And seeing him for who he is changes the way you respond when you fail. 

I heard someone say once what you really believe about Jesus doesn’t show up until you really blow it. Judas didn’t understand the gospel, despaired, and ran from him to death. 

## 4.3 recapp
But Peter did, so he dove out of the boat and swam with all his strength to get to Jesus. That’s what repentance requires: a proper understanding of who Jesus is, and a willingness to go with him to restoration, healing, and life, or what John the Baptist called, bearing fruit in keeping with repentance. 

Can you think of the last time you blew it? How did you respond? Did you make excuses and blame shift? Did you numb your humiliation and pain? Or did you go turn to Jesus and go with him to make things right? 

# 5 III. What repentance looks like

## 5.1 Jared
Let’s talk about what it looks like - I can’t improve on something Jared Wilson a few years ago. 

12 signs we have a genuinely repentant heart - I will send a link out this week: 

1. We name our sin as sin and do not spin it or excuse it, and further, we demonstrate “godly sorrow,” which is to say, a grief chiefly about the sin itself, not just a grief about being caught or having to deal with the consequences of sin.

2. We actually confessed before we were caught or the circumstantial consequences of our sin caught up with us.

3. If found out, we confess immediately or very soon after and “come clean,” rather than having to have the full truth pulled from us. Real repentance is typically accompanied by transparency.

4. We have a willingness and eagerness to make amends. We will do whatever it takes to make things right and to demonstrate we have changed.

5. We are patient with those we’ve hurt or victimized, spending as much time as is required listening to them without jumping to defend ourselves.

6. We are patient with those we’ve hurt or victimized as they process their hurt, and we don’t pressure them or “guilt” them into forgiving us.

7. We are willing to confess our sin even in the face of serious consequences (including undergoing church discipline, having to go to jail, or having a spouse leave us).

8. We may grieve the consequences of our sin but we do not bristle under them or resent them. We understand that sometimes our sin causes great damage to others that is not healed in the short term (or perhaps ever).

9. If our sin involves addiction or a pattern of behavior, we do not neglect to seek help with a counselor, a solid twelve-step program, or even a rehabilitation center.

10. We don’t resent accountability, pastoral rebuke, or church discipline.

11. We seek our comfort in the grace of God in Jesus Christ, not simply in being free of the consequences of our sin.

12. We are humble and teachable.

That’s what it looks like when a sinner being truly aware of his sinfulness, understands the mercies of God in Christ, grieves for and hates his sin, and turns from them to God, fully intending and striving for a new obedience. 

So let me ask this question: 

## 5.2 Why does Judas despair AR
I want to spend a moment addressing Judas’ end. There are at least four failures on Judas’ part that drive him to despair. 
**- A failure of accounting** - As far as I can tell, Judas was never in this thing for the right reasons. He was with Jesus when it was profitable and out when it was costly. He never grasped the economics of the upside-down kingdom. 
**- A failure of relationship** - Where Peter had gotten to know Jesus intimately in three years of following him, Judas’ problem was that he hadn’t. That’s why his heart was not fully aligned with Jesus. And at this point, as both Luke and John tell us, Satan has entered him. He is not in relationship with Jesus, so he does not understand the mercies of God in Christ. 

## 5.3 P(L)E 
**- A failure of perspective** - The horizon of his gaze was consumed by his failure. McCheyne once said, “For every look at yourself, take ten looks to Christ.” Judas couldn’t do that, so he was without hope in the end. Again, contrast this with Peter - I can’t help but wonder if, as Peter contemplated his denial of Jesus, he didn’t hold fast to the words Jesus said moments before he predicted Peter’s denial - 
> Luke 22:31 “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, 32 but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.” 
Just like God’s word to Adam and Eve in Genesis 3, even as the hard word of the reality of judgment is given, grace and hope is promised. I have to wonder if that why he was able to endure his own dark night. But for Judas, because of his failure of accounting, relationship, and perspective, he had
**- A failure of endurance -** Judas didn’t make it to Easter Sunday. And he couldn’t see the the fullness of how Jesus took care of it for him; all he could do was deal with it himself. 

# 6 Suicide
## 6.1 What suicide is
Let me speak for just a moment about Judas’ act of taking his own life, what it is and what it is not. What it is is a terrible sin. The 6th Commandment forbids suicide insofar as it is self-murder. Anywhere suicide is described in Scripture, it’s framed in a negative light and associated with disobedience, shame, and hopelessness - you see with Samson in Judges, Zimri in 1 Kings, and Judas here. 

At several points, people in Scripture ask God to take their lives in a trial; God never grants it (Moses in Numbers 11, Elijah in 1 Kings 19, Jonah in Jonah 4). 

## 6.2 What suicide isn’t
Suicide is a sin. That’s what it is. But what it is not is unpardonable sin. And I want to speak to the pain someone of you may carry concerning the eternal soul of someone who has committed suicide. Suicide is wrong. But just as all your holy living and service to God cannot earn you entrance **into** the kingdom of heaven, one act of despair and desperation cannot **take you out** of the kingdom of heaven. 

Some argue that you can’t repent of that sin before you stand before the judgment seat. Well, all of us will have sins for which we have not repented when we stand before the judgment seat. And for all our sin, confessed and unconfessed, we will plead the all-sufficient merit of Jesus. 

## 6.3 past present future, weight of despair
The Bible does not say that suicide is an unforgivable or unpardonable sin. It also teaches that all sin--past, present, and future--is forgiven through faith in the atoning death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Even still, let me hold out this hope to those of you who might struggle with the crushing weight of despair. There is a despair and sickness of soul, mind, and body that can feel like too much to endure. But Jesus came low to meet you and suffer with you there in that very place, abides with you there in that very place, and brings his kingdom there in that very place. 

And so when you’ve lost every other hold you have on life, you can hold fast to him, fully assured that he is holding fast to you. 

# 7 Conclusion

## 7.1 Chappell
Bryan Chappell once preached the funeral of a beloved and faithful pastor who slipped into a crushing depression and committed suicide. And he offered the same hope I have offered this morning. And he added this:

> I know that some will fear that if I do not shut the door to heaven to (your pastor) for this particular sin that I may open the door for some others to consider doing what he did. I know that is a great danger, but the greater danger is to portray my God as who does not understand human weakness and who draws a line beyond which his love will not go. I fear more the daily and eternal despair of belief in that god. The God we need is the one Scripture promises: the One who loves you so much that he gave his Son for you so that you need not fear even your greatest failures will deny you his eternal kingdom or his heart. Love for that God of grace will do more to hold you to life than all threats of hell from a god you dread and wish to flee. The Bible says the kindness of God leads us to repentance and draws us to life with cords of divine affection that nothing can sever. In that assurance, there is love that is more powerful than death.

## 7.2 BI necessary to mourn, insufficient
The gentle kindness of our Savior invites you to recognize that seeing to sin ourselves is death, but coming to the Savior in our sin is life.

This is what all the disciples have to do. It’s not wrong to mourn your sin, to weep bitterly over your sin. In fact, you must do that. But you must not stop there. You must come to Jesus in our sin. Just like Peter did. 

## 7.3 All of us JD
Just like all of us have - Please understand - I’m not standing up here because I’ve gotten my sin stuff all sorted out. There is not one person in this building right now who has fixed their sin issues. We are a room of spiritual deserters and betrayers. 

And that’s why Jesus came, to go to the cross to deal with our sin and unite us to himself. 

JD Greear - 
> Judas couldn't see that Jesus' imminent death was not just a _result _of Judas' actions but intended as the _redemption_ for Judas' actions.

No matter what you’ve done, no matter what’s been done to you, you’re not too broken or defiled or sinful or ashamed for Jesus. He is not ashamed to be called your brother. And he tasted death so that you might have life, and that more abundantly.
